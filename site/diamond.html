            The History of the Monk Diamond
        </div>
        <div style="padding:50px; width:100%;">
            <p>The Monk Diamond is famous for its distinctive green colour.<br/>A Russian nobleman bought
                the diamond for his wife in 1889, but it was stolen during the Russian Revolution. For
                the next 30 years, the Monk Diamond’s whereabouts were unknown.<br/>In 1947 it was
                discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in Moscow.<br/> It was returned
                to the nobleman’s family. The nobleman’s son decided the Monk Diamond was unlucky
                and sold it to the House of Volkov, Moscow’s oldest jewellery house.<br/>The House of Volkov
                paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumoured to be the most expensive diamond sale ever.</p>
